            <h2 class="text-center">Nature’s Most Amazing Eyes Just Got A Bit Weirder</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Eyes are testaments to evolution’s creativity. They all do the same basic
                things—detect light, and convert it into electrical signals—but in such a wondrous variety of ways.
                There are single and compound eyes, bifocal lenses and rocky ones, mirrors and optic fibres. And there
                are eyes that are so alien, so constantly surprising, that after decades of research, scientists have
                only just about figured out how they work, let alone why they evolved that way. To find them, you need
                to go for a swim.</p>

            <p>Most people have three types of light-detecting cells, or photoreceptors, which are sensitive to red,
                green and blue light. But the mantis shrimp has anywhere from 12 to 16 different photoreceptors in its
                midband. Most people assume that they must therefore be really good at seeing a wide range of colours—a
                “thermonuclear bomb of light and beauty”, as the Oatmeal put it. But last year, Hanna Thoen from the
                University of Queensland found that they’re much worse at discriminating between coloursthey’re much
                worse at discriminating between coloursthey’re much worse at discriminating between coloursthey’re much
                worse at discriminating between coloursthey’re much worse at discriminating between colours than most
                other animals! They seem to use their dozen-plus receptors to recognise colours in a unique way that’s
                very different to other animals but oddly similar to some satellites.</p>
